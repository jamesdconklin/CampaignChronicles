# Class Recommendations for Wrath of the Righteous
I'll be offering a handful of suggestions for classes I think would be fun and effective for this campaign. I'll be separating the recommendations by a few criteria, like hands-on player experience versus theoretical and standalone classes versus classes I think really benefit from a dip in an auxiliary class.

## Classes I've played extensively.
I've played all these classes extensively within Organized Play, and have found them rewarding in terms of engagement, entertainment, and efficacy. Granted, the challenges faced in Society play are rather more diverse then you'd see in such a focused campaign like WotR, but I think things should translate well.

### \#1: [The Warpriest](https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Warpriest)
Warpriests are lords of buffs and kings of the action economy. Their signature ability, fervor, allows them to buff themselves as a swift action (read: free action you can only do once a turn), allowing them to be a real monster on the battlefield with no preparation from the very first round. Their Sacred Weapon ability scales the damage dice of any weapon they've selected for Weapon Focus, allowing warpriests to wield daggers that bite as deep as a battle-axe or loose arrows that strike like cannons. Their Blessings, like cleric domains, provide strong utility depending on the choice, like summons, teleportation, or countering battlefield control.

Warpriests get 6-level divine casting keyed to wisdom, the ability to instantly prepare themselves for battle, the ability to channel positive or negative energy, and other signs of their deity's favor

Play a warpriest if you want to lead your allies by example as you test your steel and your god's might against the hordes of the abyss.

Don't play a warpriest if their rather involved level of resource management (limited spells, limited fervor, limited blessings, limited sacred weapon/armor uses) gets you down.

### \#2: [The Investigator](https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Occultist)

Investigators know that a keen mind can cut as quick as a rapier, both in matters of combat and in those of intrigue. Like warpriests, they have a tendency towards self-buffs, with alchemical casting that can provide a spread of frightening transformations or their signature Inspiration ability, which allows them to add a second, smaller die to many d20 rolls when they think the current number isn't looking so hot. A little deeper into their career, they can literally turn their insights into their enemies into combat prowess, gaining flat bonuses to attack and damage by studying their targets.

Full disclosure, though: Investigators really benefit from a quick multiclass into a more martially oriented character. The one I played from 1 to 12 dipped into Swashbuckler to gain a foundation of martial ability that carried the character until she hit level 5 and her Studied Combat came online. It is definitely a balancing act to get to combat competence with the class, but oftentimes they're so quick-witted or resourceful that they can avoid fights entirely.

Investigators get 6-level alchemical casting tied to intelligence, the ability to modify their rolls after the fact but before success or failure is declared, and the ability to study their enemies to improve their combat prowess against that particular target.

Play an investigator if you want to think your way around every problem, in and out of combat.

Don't play an investigator if you're not up to the challenge of either making a pure build combat-ready or delaying the progression of your alchemy and studied combat to anchor the class on a suitable martial dip.

### \#3: [The Bard](https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Bard)

I don't think the bard's changed too noticeably since earlier editions. Bards make just about everyone else better at what they do as a baseline, and they make everything they themselves do look good. As versatile as one of their keystone features suggest, they can be buffers, debuffers, controllers, conversationalists, sneak-thieves, combatants, or some combination of the above. More than this, as a core class, they got a lot of love from the mythic ruleset.

Bards get 6-level arcane casting, they can use their ability in various Perform skills to augment their allies' fighting ability or ward off various ill effects, and they can substitute their bonuses in these Perform skills for various skills governing social interaction.

Play a bard if you want to talk, sing, and dance your way around every problem, befuddle your enemies, and inspire your friends to greatness.

Don't play a bard if you'd prefer to be more self-sufficient, though this is far from a condemnation of the class.

### \#4: [The Medium](https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Medium)

Warnings first: The Medium class is super complicated. It's basically six classes in one, or rather a different class each day, and, like the Investigator, it too benefits immensely from a dip in a martial class to provide a base on which to build.

Investigators let the spirits of heroes and villains past lease their body, granting prowess in moments what other classes might spend years accumulating. Want to be a fighter? Channel a Champion and you're just about good to go. Need to heal the sufferers of a plague? Go-go gadget Hierophant! Do you have a lot of friends who could make your problems go away with a little help? Marshal says, "follow me!"

Did you just fail a roll? Are you sure? Why not just grant the spirit in your head a little more control? Surely it can put its finger on the scales and turn that 17 into a 20.

The class is so rich in roleplay potential and day-to-day flexibility, and, if built right, can even excel in a few areas instead of falling into the usual "Jack of all trades, master of none" trap. As with my investigator, my medium dipped swashbuckler on her way to being the bane of Society Play GMs everywhere (ask Nick). Outside the confines of PFS, you have some even richer options available, like leveraging the ability to pick and choose divine or arcane spells to be a premier item crafter.

Mediums get 4-level psychic casting with the ability to channel spirits granting 6-level arcane or divine casting, augmenting their offenses, shoring up their defense, granting a rogue-like proficiency with sneak attacks and skills, or bolstering their allies. They also gain the ability to trade agency to their inhabiting spirit to boost a roll tied to that spirit's interests after the roll is declared a failure.

Play a medium if you want to be able to meet any challenge, at least with a day of prep, if you relish the roleplay potential of finding and hosting suitable spirits, and if you're okay with literally keeping 6 different character sheets.

Don't play a medium if your mental arithmetic clocks in below a TI-83 or if you otherwise want something simpler.

### \#5: [The Occultist](https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Occultist)

Occultists are all about the bling. They collect implements, material sources of psychic power. Each day, an occultist invests a portion of their own mind into these items and uses them to focus his magic, whether through spells or potent focus powers.

Like Warpriests, Occultists are somewhat unique among casters in having full martial weapon proficiency, good armor proficiencies, and a strong Fortitude save. They give up a lot of magical potency in dropping from 9-level casting to 6, but they get a lot of it back in their focus powers - single selectable abilities that spike way higher than a full caster could hope for at an equivalent level. Think, "sure, I cast fewer spells than you and of a lower level, but my Telekinesis blows yours out of the water." They're also just so damn flavorful, able to read psychic impressions from the past owners of objects and summon lesser outsiders to act as information gophers.

Occultists get 6-level psychic casting, passive buffs from how they invest their focus each day, and a smorgasbord of interesting options that boil down to "Like this spell an equivalent wizard just learned, but better."

Play an occultist if you want to basically be a tougher wizard with reduced casting but bolstered by a limited set of focused abilities that would leave the full casters salivating.

Don't play an occultist unless you can deal with their complexity. Handling all the mental focus passives and actives gets pretty gnarly.

## Classes I have not personally played
This list is more drawn from common sense or talking with fellow players, and as such my descriptions will be far less colorful. Don't take this as lack of endorsement, though. These may be better by any rubric than those above.

### \#1: [Paladin](https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Paladin)
This is the iconic class for the campaign. Wrath of the Righteous overflows almost literally with evil outsiders, and Paladins are the single most qualified class to handle such foes. Their smites neutralize a key defense in damage reduction as well as mightily boosting your defenses and offenses against your designated foe based on your level and your charisma and corresponding conviction in your deity's tenets. Between that and the ability to rapidly heal themselves between rounds, paladins are a lasting and potent force in this campaign, and easy to hook into the overall story.

We already have a paladin in the party, but it's a super odd-ball archetype, so you could quite easily find a niche to fill. You could go super-unorthodox and play the defensively oriented Sacred Shield paladin, whose purpose boils down to "I make everyone around me hard to hit" or "I make myself hard to hit, and everyone near me takes half damage from your attacks. Good luck."

### \#2: [Ranger](https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Ranger)
Rangers choose types of enemies to be very good against, and choose a combat style to excel in. Take these together in a campaign with a distinct lack of diversity in the most dangerous threats you'll be facing, and you enjoy much the same suitability as the paladin does.

The easiest build here would probably be an archer focusing all the Favored Enemy magic on Outsiders [Evil], but you can definitely find a combat style that tickles your fancy - we're not restricted to just Archery or Two-Weapon Fighting anymore. Ask Kevin - he plays two different types of rangers in the campaigns I run.

The fact that they also have a lot of skill points to play with makes them easier to swallow from a role-play/out of combat perspective.

### \#3: [Rogue (Unchained)](<https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Rogue%20%28Unchained%29)

Rogues got a lot of love in Pathfinder with the release of Pathfinder Unchained. The improved class takes care of a lot of the feat taxes and overall lack of sizzle that plagued the original formulation. Unchained rogues have almost everything they need by level 3 - strong and scaling sneak attack, weapon finesse, and Dexterity to damage with their weapon of choice, which leaves Rogues free to specialize however they want beyond that. Want to be a party face? You've got the skill points for that. Scout and trap-breaker? You probably still have the skills for that. So you want to apply crippling conditions to your sneak attacks? Well, you don't need to select them anymore because you already have it after L4, but feel free to pile on more pain with one of your Rogue talent selections.

Basically, Rogues are skills and spike damage. As long as you have a basic understanding of how positioning, movement, and opportunity attacks work in the system, you can make them combat-effective, and everything else is gravy.


### \#4: [Barbarian](https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Barbarian)/[Bloodrager](https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Bloodrager)
These guys get angry and strong and then beat things to death. The out-of-combat roleplaying potential tends to be a bit limited, though maybe my perspective here is colored by a particular meat-head barbarian player in PFS (I'll ask Nick to guess who), but there's none handier in a fight. Plus, mythic rules give some crazy options for staying alive even when your hit points say otherwise, a deficit spending of sorts, so Barbarians can stay angry until their enemies are gone and their allies stitch the Barbarian back together before his rage subsides and stops holding his guts in.

### \#5: [Kineticist](https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Kineticist)
These guys are basically the benders from the Avatar franchise. They're casters of a sort, except they never run out of their basic mojo and can bring the hurt all day. Fly by shooting great gouts of fire behind you, freeze your enemies solid, or protect yourself by encasing yourself in stone. Maybe not all at the same time or from the same person, but each element grants a unique blend of offense, defense, and utility.

A word of caution: Choose a physical element. Getting past DR through sheer damage is a lot easier than working around energy resistances or immunities.

### \#6: [Alchemist](https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Alchemist)
Blow stuff up. Alchemists cast the same sort of spells as the investigator, but they also throw alchemical firebombs. Lots of them. Later on they might also throw frost bombs or sticky bombs or, more apropos to this campaign, bombs imbued with holy energy. They're similar to Kineticists in their tendency to dish out one big ranged attack per turn, but they're a little better rounded in skills and in the utility their spellcasting provides.

Alchemists are also profoundly proficient with other, non-bomb splash weapons, so you can deal mouth-watering damage to undead and demons with garden variety holy water.
