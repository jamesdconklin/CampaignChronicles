1. Make your contributions to the campaign's [Lines and Veils document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yo_4X9RlPKXkb0uF7NClHCkcHMH-8xDFui_E1nDq6v8/edit)
  - Remember to edit from an incognito/private window if you'd like to keep your lines/veils anonymous

2. Finish Characters (Let's pencil Tuesday the 18th as a deadline)
  - Add a google doc for your character to the campaign's [PC folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EYD-B6A3K8gJu3weE_lIVHVt7t434v80)
  - State the character's name and a brief description at the top.
  - Fill out all backstory Phases. Make sure they are labeled and followed by their linked Aspects. [SRD Reference](https://www.vsca.ca/Diaspora/diaspora-srd.html#characters) or Ch.3, p.32 in the book
  - Define your character's skill pyramid, i.e. one skill at five points, two at four, and so on down to five at one. [SRD Reference](https://www.vsca.ca/Diaspora/diaspora-srd.html#skills) or Ch.3, p.34 in the book
    - Consider including one skill that contributes to space combat or upkeep. We've got a fancy ship. I think it's appropriate that we fly it instead of random NPCs. These skills follow:
      - **Brokerage**: Keep the ship fueled, provisioned, employed, and in otherwise holistic working order. Notably, where other stations are considered staffed by an NPC with a relevant skill of 2 if not held by a PC, there is no default broker.
      - **Communications**: Operating the ship's Electronic Warfare suite to attack opposing ship's Data tracks and defend from the same
      - **Computers**: Repairing damage to the ship's Data track
      - **Engineering**: Repairing damage to the ship's Frame track
      - **Gunnery**: Operating the ship's Beam or Torpedo batteries
      - **Navigation**: Determine initial positioning in space combat
      - **Pilot**: Maneuvering the ship

  - Decide on your stunts. Even if you're using a predefined stunt, please include a definition.  [SRD Reference](https://www.vsca.ca/Diaspora/diaspora-srd.html#stunts) or Ch.3, p.45 in the book
    - A reminder about **Have a Thing** stunts. When you Have a Thing, the ref cannot permanently remove or destroy the thing. Crucially, you get the ship regardless of if you Have a Thing the ship, but unless you spend two stunts to do so, the ship is at risk of permanent loss.
3. Spec and name the ship (Pencil in the 25th as a deadline)
  * Considering what came up in character creation, we should decide what the ship's original official mandate was. We know it's exploring wormhole tech. Considering Dr. Machaca's rather extreme approaches, we might want to hash out what the building organizations were (Governments? Megacorps?), as well as what their intent was after the ship set off proper.
  * The ship is Humanity's first and only T2 Ship. Ship design is covered in [the SRD](https://www.vsca.ca/Diaspora/diaspora-srd.html#spacecraft-design) or in Ch.9, p.225 in the book, but the rules and our addenda to them will be summarized below:
    - T2 Spacecraft have 17 build points to spend
    - Spacecraft have 5 core stats:
      - **V-Shift** describes acceleration and, indirectly, range before needing to restock reaction mass. To make full use of a spacecraft's V-Shift rating, it must be piloted by a character whose **Pilot** skill matches or exceeds the rating.
      - **Beam** covers short-range, unguided weaponry. They could cover laser batteries, railguns, or more conventional cannons. They are used both to attack other ships and to defend from hostile torpedoes. A character at a ship's gunnery station can use their **Gunnery** skill to use and improve a ship's beam capabilities.
      - **Torpedo** encompasses long-range, guided missiles. A character at a ship's gunnery station can use their **Gunnery** skill to use and improve a ship's torpedo capabilities.
      - **EW** is electronic warfare, or a ship's ability to attack opposing ship networks or overwhelm their sensors and sensitive electronics with jamming signals. It also includes defending against such attacks. A character at a ship's Comms station can use their **Communication** skill to use and improve a ship's EW capabilities.
      - **Trade** describes the ship's ability to maintain its own operation through paid work. How much cargo can it carry? How easy is it to repair and maintain? What services does it enable the crew to provide. In our campaign, because this is a research vessel, we might model this as "How well can the ship harvest fuel, reaction mass, and other necessities from raw resources?" and "How valuable is our technology to potential trade partners?" I doubt our ship will be doing long-term caravan work. Trade is augmented by the **Brokerage** skill of any PCs on the crew when making any required upkeep rolls.
    - (Addendum) The ship has a cryonics bay with an embryo bank and most of the crew in cryosleep. This will be represented by the Aspect "Very Precious Cargo."
    - (Addendum) The ship must spend 1bp on the **T2 Slip Drive** stunt
    - (Addendum) If there are no players with the **MG Pilot** stunt, the ship must spend 3bp on the **Civilian** stunt.
    - (Addendum) We should strongly consider spending 1bp on the **Interface Vehicle** stunt so we can touch down on new worlds.

  * If we agree to equip the ship with an onboard intelligence, I suggest it follow these rules
    - The intelligence will be statted as a 3-cap NPC. [SRD Reference](https://www.vsca.ca/Diaspora/diaspora-srd.html#non-player-characters) or Ch.4, p.60 in the book
    - The intelligence should have a name thematically linked to that of the ship.
    - By default, the intelligence should have access only to its internal databanks and to a single output terminal. It can be granted access to other ship systems only by crewmen, with the duration and extent of access clearly laid out and capped by the crewman's own privileges. An example might be as follows, presuming the shipboard intelligence to be statted as a navigator and pilot:

      > **Crewman**: Computer, I've a question for [Intelligence]  
      **Computer**: Granting PA access to [Intelligence]. [Intelligence] is listening at your station.  
      **Crewman**: [Intelligence], we're running low on r-mass. Our destination is a metastable wormhole at coordinates 39.012, 5.49, 1.37e7 klicks. Can you calculate a gravity-assisted approach that'll get us there within a month?  
      **Computer**: [Intelligence] is requesting access to astrographic sensor data and internal status sensors, scoped to fuel reserves. Estimates an upper bound of one minute to finish calculations.  
      **Crewman**: I grant it.  
      **[Intelligence]**: By slingshotting around the fourth moon of the sixth planet, around the third planet, and around the first planet, this vessel can arrive at the destination in 27 Earth-standard days, 13 hours, 42 minutes. The necessary burns will consume half our remaining reaction mass, leaving roughly 14% of our total capacity.  
      **Crewman**: Thank you, [Intelligence]. Please start the necessary maneuvers. Computer, grant [Intelligence] access to flight controls until we get there, along with the necessary r-mass reserves.  
      **Computer**: Crewman, your access is sufficient for only a 5% r-mass expenditure and a flight control grant of five days.  
      **Crewman**: Let's start with that. We'll continue this conversation with the Captain before the day's out.

    - You might notice some stilted dialogue above. It's intentional. I think the intelligence's inclusion is more interesting if the designers are very wary and cagey about installing it. Basically, if it ever oversteps its bounds, its ability to interfere with vessel operations is limited by what access the crew grants it, and said access is always tightly bounded in scope (i.e. what the intelligence can do) and duration. I also think it'd be interesting if the thing was programmed to be unable to describe or refer to itself. Considering that one of the technological Armageddons Diaspora proposes as a possibility for Tech-4 civilizations is AI takeover, these shackles offer a weighty choice: Do we accept the risks in removing certain limits on the shipboard intelligence in order to improve its capabilities so that it can better help us in our mission? Food for thought.

4.  Come to consensus on the broad strokes of the first mission.
  - We've agreed on the gist of the campaign's arc-threat.
    - Technology beyond our comprehension, sufficient to end or subvert system-wide civilization on arrival.
    - Lacks Wormhole or other FTL tech, so slow to arrive.
    - If it ever gets FTL tech, [it's game over, man.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsx2vdn7gpY&t=13s)
  - I think we've decided that we're leaving Sol behind.
  - We haven't decided the actual fate of our system. Has this threat completely destroyed it? Has it changed it to make it irreversibly hostile to humanity? Are we leaving Earth behind and finding a new home for the last of humanity around stranger stars, or do we intend to light the beacons, bring word of this threat to whatever allies we can find, and rally an alliance to take back our home?
  - I think once the fate of Sol/Earth is settled, the other details can remain unspoiled for the first mission.
